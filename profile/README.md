# Hyuuganatsu Project
Hi! This project is still under construction.

## What does the Hyuuganatsu Project do?
It's a comprehensive project to make it easy for anyone to play with AI functionalities. We currenty have web and QQ bot as user-end, and super-resolution, text-to-speech, stable-diffusion as behind-the-scene magic.

## Project structure
There will be 5 repos, where 2~5 are submodule of the first one.

1. `hyuuganatsu_project`: The top-level entrypoint for building and deploying.
2. `orenji_bot`: The QQ bot user interface.
3. `backend`: The web backend, handling requests from QQ bot.
4. `worker`: The worker for backend, who really casts spell (deep learning computation).
5. `stable_diffusion`: The standalone service who provides anime image generation.
